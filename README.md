---

LogoLike-GUI is graphical intergrated canvas maker for LogoLike.
This repository is useful for creating and editing Your LogoLike project. 

---

If you are searching for heart of project - where user controls objects (for example crab) on screen using commands - you may want to see [LogoLike](https://github.com/sqbi-q/LogoLike).

## Installation

First, [clone](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Getting-a-Git-Repository) this repository using [git-clone](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-clone):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sqbi-q/LogoLike-GUI.git --recurse-submodules --remote-submodules
```
Using `--recurse-submodules` and `--remote-submodules` clones submodule [LogoLike](https://github.com/sqbi-q/LogoLike) (LogoLike itself needs [jsmn](https://github.com/zserge/jsmn) and [map](https://github.com/rxi/map)) that is required by code.
Then when you already have project on disk, you need to compile it.

---

# Compiling
LogoLike-GUI needs [GSON](https://github.com/google/gson) dependency to run.

### Using maven
1. Go to LogoLike-GUI root directory
2. Run `mvn package` to download libraries required by LogoLike-GUI and compile project to `./target/logolike-gui-1-jar-with-dependencies.jar`
3. Run `java -jar "logolike-gui-1-jar-with-dependencies.jar"` to execute LogoLike-GUI

## Usage

Raw LogoLike needs initalized project folder to run.
Project folder and `setting.json` are files generated by [LogoLike-gui](https://github.com/sqbi-q/LogoLike-GUI) - graphical environment written in Java, allowing building canvas of LogoLike. 

This script should be executed by LogoLike-GUI.
```bash
./LogoLike_output <RELATIVE_PATH_TO_SETTING.JSON>
``` 
Besides running compiled LogoLike code, it is passing relative path to `setting.json` inside project folder.
